# Incident Report Analysis
    An incident report analysis using NIST CSF

<h2>üìùIncident Report Analyis Summary</h2>

An Incident Report Analysis involves documenting and reporting a recent security breach. Although a Incident Report Analysis can be written utilizing any framework or even no framework whatsoever, in cybersecurity the NIST CSF is becoming a much more widely used framework. It provides a strong guideline to conduct any investigation on an organizations cybersecurity and managing security risks. 

<h2>üõ°Ô∏èNational Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)</h2>

The NIST CSF for short is a very popular cybersecurity framework created to provide organizations best practices, standards, and guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks and overall maintaining a higher level of cybersecurity posture. The NIST CSF is a great way to make it easier to understand and manage cybersecurity risks. The NIST CSF can be through 5 pillars: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, & Recover. 

- <b>Identify</b>
  - Perform routine security audits of your organization including ensuring internal networks, devices, systems, and certain access privileges are regularly checked to identify and mitigate potential security gaps.
  - Create an inventory and report of systems, assets, data, processes, people, and capabilities that need to be secured.
    - Core questions to ask yourself as you identify security risks:
      - Hardware/Asset management: Which software, systems, networks, or other key organizational assets were affected?
      - Business Processes: Which business processes, if any, were affected during the attack? Were non-critical and/or critical business procedures affected?
      - People: Which individuals need access to affected systems?

- <b>Protect</b>
  - Create a strategy/plan to better protect organizational assets through creating and implementing stronger policies, training, tools, and procedures that will help mitigate future potential security risks.
  - Implementing safeguards to protect important assets and ensure business services can be consistently delivered.
    - Core questions to ask yourself as you protect against security risks:
      - Access Control: Which individuals need access to affected artifacts. How can we ensure non-trusted sources do not have access to certain systems?
      - Training: Who needs to be aware of policies in the event a security breach occurs? How can we implement new training policies to ensure the breach has a very low likelihood of occurring again?
      - Data Security: Was there any data that had a lack of security? How can we improve on that security?
      - Maintenance and Updates: Were there any systems, software, or hardware that needed to be updated? If so, how we can develop a procedure to ensure all assets are kept up-to-date?
      - Protective Technologies: Were there any Intrusion Prevention Systems, Instrusion Detection Systems, firewalls, or any other protective technology that was implemented? If not, what systems should be implemented to have better security?

- <b>Detect</b>
  - Check for potential security vulnerabilities or possible previously existing attack vectors to mitigate attack surface and increase speed and efficiency of detections.
  - Design and implement a stronger system that utilizes security tools to help detect future threats and attacks:
    - Core questions to ask yourself when trying to detect security risks:
      - Anomaly and Event Detection: How can we implement tools designed to notify IT security staff of anomalies and security events, such as using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools?
      - Continuous Security Monitoring: What tools or processes can we use to constantly monitor systems, softwares, or hardware without hindering business productivity?
      - Detection: What tools are used to detect security events? What tools need to be implemented to detect threats and security events?
     
- <b>Respond</b>
  - Ensure proper procedures, processes, tools, and guidelines are used in order to contain, neutralize, and examine security incidents
  - Design plans to respond to threats and attacks
    - Core questions to ask yourself when trying to detect security risks:
      - Planning: What plans need to be implemented to better efficiently respond to security threats and attacks?
      - Communication: How can IT security staff ensure the procedures on how to respond are communicated within the entire organization and with individuals directly affected by the attack, including staff and users?
      - Analysis: How we can effectively analyze the security incident to better handle a future situation?
      - Mitigation: What necessary steps used to respond can be taken to mitigate the impact of a security incident such as isolating resources or offlining affected systems?
      - Improvements: What improvements need to be impelemented in order to develop a more effective procedure for responding?
     
- <b>Recover</b>
